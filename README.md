 AquaCheck - 
Probability-Based Water Safety Test . A predictive system that determines water quality using statistical and probabilistic techniques.
AquaCheck is designed to assess the safety of drinking water by analyzing its quality through statistical and probabilistic methods. The goal is to predict whether a given water sample is safe for consumption based on key parameters such as pH, turbidity, dissolved solids, and other contaminants.

Main Features:
Data Collection & Analysis – Takes input from water quality parameters (pH level, TDS, turbidity, etc.).
Statistical Modeling – Uses probability-based techniques to determine water safety.
Prediction System – Classifies water as Safe or Unsafe based on statistical thresholds.
User-Friendly Interface – (If applicable) Allows users to input values and get instant results.
Report Generation – (Optional) Provides a summary of water safety based on analyzed parameters.
Machine Learning Integration – (If included) Enhances prediction accuracy through trained models.
